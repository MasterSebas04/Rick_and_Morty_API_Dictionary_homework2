# Awesome Rick and Morty Character Catalog

Homework #2: React Web Application with API

## Description

A web app built in react in which users input the name of a character from the Rick and Morty franchise. Thhrough an API with over 800 characters, a photo of the requested character, along with their ID number, status, species origin and current location is shown on screen.

### Theme

To make the website and official look, I chose to use fonts directly from the show for the title and the Adult Swim font for the character's information, since the show airs on Adult Swim. The layout is inspited by an ID card or drivers liscence to give a clean/official feel to the page, contrasting the show's completely unserious feel.
